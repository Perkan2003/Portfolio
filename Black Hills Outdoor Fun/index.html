            My family and I visited the Black Hills this week, and a friend had
            recommended the ATV tour with Black Hills Outdoor Fun. We are super
            glad we took the recommendation because we had a blast!
          </p>
          <p class="testimonial-text fs-6">
            Chuck and Julie were absolutely wonderful, and very knowledgeable on
            the area. The tour last a little longer then 4 hours, and Chuck took
            us on an amazing venture deep in the Black Hills. He showed us a
            small lake, took us on a hike to show us an old mining area, and we
            rode on various ATV trails.
          </p>
          <p class="testimonial-text fs-6">
            If you are not experienced on ATVs, no worries! Chuck showed us how
            to use the machines, and it was pretty easy. The great thing is they
            have UTVs that can sit 3-6 riders, and it’s perfect for families! We
            had such a great time, and would recommend making this a “must do
            activity” if you’re visiting the Black Hills

            My wife and I were looking for a way to see more of the Black Hills.
            We stumbled upon Black Hills Outdoor fun and made a last minute
            reservation. From the start Julie was great to work with. She was
            very helpful in making the reservation. She emails a map with
            directions from your hotel and what you need to bring.
          </p>
          <p class="testimonial-text fs-6">
            Check in was a breeze. Julie recommended helmets, goggles and
            bandanas for the ride. We are happy that we took the goggles and
            bandanas as it was very dusty. You will be covered with dust when
            you leave. Chuck was...great to work with. He shows you how to
            operate the UTV if needed. He is very informative and takes you to
            areas in the Black Hills that you would never find on your own.
            Chuck takes you to an old homestead and the ‘hole in the wall’ and
            provides interesting history on the area. He stops often to check on
            everyone. Cold water and some snacks are provided during the ride if
            needed.
          </p>
          <p class="testimonial-text fs-6">
            We enjoyed the 4 hour tour and the trails in the Black Hills. The
            UTV was rugged, easy to handle and surprisingly comfortable. My wife
            and I commented several times during the trip about how comfortable
            the seats were on the rough terrain. ...lets you enjoy the ride and
            scenery without having to worry about where you are going and how
            you will get out. I highly recommend this ride for couples and
            families.

                  When you are riding in the Black Hills, you should always keep
                  in mind that the weather can change in an instant. Here is our
                  suggested list of what to bring for your ATV ride:
                </p>
                <ul class="info-card-list info-card-text fs-6">
                  <li>
                    Sunglasses or some sort of eye protection. Goggles
                    (non-tinted) are available with the rental
                  </li>
                  <li>Waterproof and breathable rain gear</li>
                  <li>
                    Extra Clothing: Dressing in layers is wise but also remember
                    to bring extra clothing if it turns cold.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Sunscreen: While it may feel cool in the mountains, the UV
                    rays are much more intense at higher elevations and you will
                    burn faster.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Backpack or other type of pack to secure your personal
                    items, including your phone or camera. Trails and ATV’s can

                  All gear is provided and included in the ATV rental cost. It
                  includes helmets and goggles. South Dakota state law requires
                  anyone the age 18 and younger, must wear a helmet. Anyone age

                  A short historical hike is also involved. Those not
                  wanting/unable to take this hike will remain with the units in
                  a scenic area.

                  Unlike other companies, there are
                  <strong>no additional charges</strong> for fuel or atv
                  cleaning.
